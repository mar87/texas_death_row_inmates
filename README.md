Project completed by Drew Jordan, Gonzalos Bustos, Sara Normoyle and Megan Robertson for Statistics 521 - Predictive Modeling at Duke University in Fall 2015 with Professor Beka Steorts.

We investigate the similarities and differences between the inmates who have been executed in Texas using text mining and clustering techniques. The crimes and last statements of each inmate are assigned a topic through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The k-modes clustering algorithm is used to group similar inmates and determine if similar inmates touch on the same subjects in their last statements. This project provides insight into the characteristics of executed prisoners in Texas, and extracts information from the descriptions of their crimes and last statements.
