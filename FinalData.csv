The troopers followed Hughes's car on  Interstate 10 until it exited the highway. At this point, Trooper Frederick,  who was driving, turned on the overhead lights, and Hughes pulled over to the  shoulder of the exit ramp. Trooper Frederick  exited the police car and walked up to the driver's side door of Hughes's car.  Trooper Reichert got out of the patrol car almost immediately after Frederick did. Approaching  the Ford behind Frederick, Reichert heard a  muffled shot and observed Frederick  grunt and lurch to the side. Hughes immediately sped away from the scene as  Trooper Reichert fired six times at the fleeing vehicle. Trooper Reichert then  called for assistance and tended to Trooper Frederick; however, Reichert could  find no pulse. Trooper Mark Frederick was later declared dead in the ambulance  en route to the Sealy   Medical Center.Upon hearing of the shooting, DPS Troopers  Randall Baisch and Rodney Green were proceeding toward the scene when they  discovered Hughes's abandoned car approximately three miles from the scene of  the shooting. The troopers observed that the car had been struck by several bullets,  and inside the car was a holster and a room key from the Days Inn Motel in  Brookshire.Soon  thereafter, a massive manhunt began for Hughes, involving as many as five  hundred law enforcement officers. Approximately two-and-a-half days after the  shooting, Texas Ranger Ray Scholton, who was in charge of the investigation,  received a report that a possible suspect had been sighted six miles south of  Sealy. Ranger Scholton went to the location by helicopter, where he spotted  Hughes hiding under a mesquite tree in a pasture. As the helicopter hovered a  few feet above the ground, Hughes pointed a gun at the helicopter. As soon as  Ranger Scholton pointed his gun out the helicopter at Hughes, Hughes dropped  his weapon and was taken into custody.A check of Hughes's car revealed that it had  been reported stolen. A search of the car revealed the following items: one  holster for an automatic handgun on the front seat, one holster for a revolver  in the glove compartment, and the following items in the trunk of the car: a  fully loaded .30 caliber carbine; a loaded, sawed-off short barrel twelve-gauge  shotgun; a .300 Magnum rifle; extra .38 caliber shotgun ammunition; and a  Halloween mask.

No man in this world has had a better family than me. I had the best parents in the world. I had the best brothers and sisters in the world. I've had the most wonderful life any man could have ever had. I've never been more proud of anybody than I have of my daughter and my son. I've got no complaints and no regrets about that. I love everyone of them and have always been loved all of my life. I've never had any doubts about that. Couple of matters that I want to talk about since this is one of the few times people will listen to what I have to say. The Unites States has gotten to a now where they zero respect for human life. My death is just a symptom of a bigger illness. At some point the government has got to wake up and stop doing things to destroy other countries and killing innocent children. The ongoing embargo and sanctions against places like Iran and Iraq, Cuba and other places. They are not doing anything to change the world, but they are harming innocent children. That's got to stop at some point. Perhaps more important in a lot of ways is what we are doing to the environment is even more devastating because as long as we keep going the direction we're going the end result is it won't matter how we treat other people because everybody on the planet will be on their way out. We have got to wake up and stop doing that. Ah, one of the few ways in the world the truth is ever going to get out, or people are ever going to know what's happening as long as we support a free press out there. I see the press struggling to stay existent as a free institution One of the few truly free institutions is the press in Texas. People like the Texas Observer and I want to thank them for the job they've done in keeping me and everybody else informed. I hope people out there will support them, listen to them and be there for them. Without it, things like this are going to happen and nobody will even know. I love all of you. I always have I always will. I would like to address the State of Texas and specially Joe Price, the District Attorney who put me here. I want to remind Mr. Price of the mistake he made at Gene Hawthorn's trial when he said that Gene Hawthorn was telling the truth at my trial. Mr. Price is a one-eyed hunting dog. He in fact is not a one-eyed hunting dog, and in fact Gene Hawthorn lied at my trial. Everybody knew it. I'm dying tonight based on testimony, that all parties, me, the man who gave the testimony, the prosecutor he used knew it was a lie. I am hoping somebody will call him to the floor for recent comments he's made in the newspaper. It's bad enough that a prosecutor can take truth and spin on it and try to re-doctor it. But when they actually make facts up and present to the public as trial's evidence. That goes beyond fail, that's completely unforgivable and I hope somebody makes Mr. Price account for or explain the tennis shoes he is talking about that put me here. I'm still completely lost on that and I'm hoping that somebody will go back and verify the trial record and make him accountable for lying to the public and the press that way. That's really all I have to say except that I love my family. and nobody, nobody has got a better family than me. I love you booger bear. I love doodle bug, too. Don't let them ever forget me. I'll never forget them. I'll see you on the other side, okay. Bye bye Debbie. Bye bro, bye booger bear. Father Mike, Father Walsh, love you all.

But the person that committed that act is no longer here - I am.  I'm not going to struggle physically against any restraints.  I'm not going to shout, use profanity or make idle threats.  Understand though that I'm not only upset, but I'm saddened by what is happening here tonight.  I'm not only saddened, but disappointed that a system that is supposed to protect and uphold what is just and right can be so much like me when I made the same shameful mistake. If someone tried to dispose of everyone here for participating in this killing, I'd scream a resounding, ""No.""  I'd tell them to give them all the gift that they would not give me...and that's to give them all a second chance. I'm sorry that I am here.  I'm sorry that you're all here.  I'm sorry that John Luttig died.  And I'm sorry that it was something in me that caused all of this to happen to begin with.   Tonight we tell the world that there are no second chances in the eyes of justice...Tonight, we tell our children that in some instances, in some cases, killing is right. This conflict hurts us all, there are no SIDES.  The people who support this proceeding think this is justice.  The people that think that I should live think that is justice.  As difficult as it may seem, this is a clash of ideals, with both parties committed to what they feel is right.  But who's wrong if in the end we're all victims? In my heart, I have to believe that there is a peaceful compromise to our ideals.  I don't mind if there are none for me, as long as there are for those who are yet to come.  There are a lot of men like me on death row - good men - who fell to the same misguided emotions, but may not have recovered as I have.  Give those men a chance to do what's right.  Give them a chance to undo their wrongs.  A lot of them want to fix the mess they started, but don't know how.  The problem is not in that people aren't willing to help them find out, but in the system telling them it won't matter anyway.  No one wins tonight.  No one gets closure.  No one walks away victorious.","Laborer","0","convicted in the car jacking murder of 63 year old john e. lute of tyler. luttig, driving a 1987 mercedes benz, had pulled into the driveway of his home at 120 south college when he was approached by beazley and shot in the head with a .45 caliber pistol. beazley and two accomplices who had followed lute home, fled his vehicle.

McBride. The Beatitudes: Jesus lifted up his eyes on His disciples, and said, ""Blessed be the poor: for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh. Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil for the Son of Man's sake. Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for behold, your reward is great in Heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets. But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation. Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall moan and weep. Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets. The supremacy of love over gifts: I Corinthians, Chapter 13: 4-8: Love is patient, love is kind, and is not jealous, love does not brag and is no arrogant, does not act unbecoming; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away; if there tongues, they will cease. Now abide faith, hope, love, these three: but the greatest of these is love. Poem: Do not stand at my grave and weep, I am not there I do not sleep. I am the diamond glints in the snow, I am the sunlight on the ripened grain. I am the gentle autumn rain. When you awaken in the morning's hush, I am the swift uplifting rush of quiet birds in circled flight, I am the soft stars that shine at night.  Do not stand at my grave and cry, I am not there. I did not die. Signed Michael L.

Franklin was found at his home several hours later, after police traced the license number of his car. Police found his pants soaking in a pail of bloody water, found several of the nurse's personal items in a trash can. Five days later, Moran was found, nude and barely alive, in a field near the hospital. She suffered from irreversible shock and died the next morning. ","","",NA,"Other"
